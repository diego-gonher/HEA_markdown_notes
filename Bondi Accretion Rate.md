Bondi accretion is the simplest scenario for accretion around a BH. In this case, we assume that a non-rotating BH is within a medium composed entirely of also non-rotating gas (i.e. no angular momentum for the cloud).

With this setup, we estimate the fastest possible accretion rate $\dot{M}$. To do so, we take into account the speed of sound in the accreting cloud:

$$
c_s^2 = \frac{GM}{r}
$$
For Bondi accretion, we assume that the speed of the infalling matter is equal to the speed of sound, such that:

$$
r_B = \frac{GM}{c_s^2}
$$
Finally, to come up with an approximation, we can imagine the accretion rate to be simply  the density of the cloud times the velocity at which the matter is infalling times a surface area at which this is happening. That is:

$$
\dot{M}_B = 4 \pi r_B^2 \rho c_s = \frac{4 \pi G^2 M^2 \rho}{c_s^3}
$$
To slightly complicate this, we could consider that the BH is moving with a velocity $u$ through the cloud of matter. In this case, the most straightforward approximation is to set a new speed of sound for the cloud as:

$$
c_s' = \sqrt{u^2 + c_s^2}
$$
