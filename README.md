## HEA Markdown Notes

Copy of my Obsidian Vault that contains my review notes for High Energy Astro. To have your own local Obsidian Vault, you can find installations instructions [here](https://obsidian.md).

Once you have installed Obsidian, you can launch the app and go to *File >> Open Vault... >> Open folder as vault*, navigate to the directory where your local copy of all the notes in this repository are stored and click *Open*.
