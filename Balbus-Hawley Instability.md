## Instabilities in the accretion disk

Consider a fluid element that is part of the accretion disk. We know that the Keplerian angular momentum is given by $L=\sqrt{GMr}$. Now suppose that we perturb outwardly the radial coordinate of the fluid element. By conservation of angular momentum, the fluid element would decrease its angular momentum as it moves out. Since its new $L$ is less than the background matter, the perturbed fluid element falls back in. This is *stable*.

The only possible way that this becomes an instability (that is, the fluid element keeps moving outwardly after being perturbed) is if the angular momentum of the disk $L$ actually decreases as $r$ increases. This is why there is an ISCO around BHs, because the effective $L$ for the disk is a funtion with a local minima, where the region within $r_{ISCO}$ is *unstable* and the part outside of $r_{ISCO}$ is stable. 

So how do we get instabilities within the stable portion of the disk? The answer is that turbulent may be caused by an external magnetic field.

## Balbus-Hawley instability

Imagine we have a vertical magnetic field going accross the disk. The charged particles within the disk would co-rotate with the field lines. In this case, when we perturb a fluid element, the particles that are rotating too quickly move outwards, while the particles rotating too slowly move inwards. This is because the angular frequency for the rotation (given by Keplerian motion) is:

$$
\Omega \propto r^{-3/2}
$$

Thus, instabilities can occur at $r > r_{ISCO}$. 

One requirement for this to work is that the external magnetic field *needs to be weak*, otherwise the cost of bending the field is too great.
