## Questions

- How does assuming BB and getting a correct approximation allows us to conclude that optically thick accretion and inelastic scattering is happening?

## Using the BB of an optically thick sphere to calculate $T_{eff}(r)$

A simple approximation to get how the effective temperature of an accreting disk scales with the radial distance is to assume the disk radiates like an optically thick sphere, such as its luminosity is the following:

$$
L \sim 4 \pi r^2 T_{eff}^4 
$$

Now, we know from [[Luminosity of Disk]] that 

$$
L \sim \frac{GM\dot{M}}{2r}
$$

Combining these two expressions, we get the following scaling:

$$
T_{eff} = \bigg( \frac{GM\dot{M}}{8 \pi r^3 \sigma_B} 
 \bigg)^{1/4} \propto r^{-3/4}
$$

Which is the same scaling we found in [[Local Spectral Temperature]]! This leads us to conclude that optically thick accretion and ellastic scattering is indeed going on in these accretion disks.
