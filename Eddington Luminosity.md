The Eddington luminosity is the luminosity of an object in the limit in which two opposing forces, gravity and radiation pressure, balance each other. Specifically, we have gravity trying to collapse the object, while radiation pressure is opposing this collapse and holding the object's structure. To derive it, we consider both forces acting upon a proton:

First, gravity is given by the usual:

$$
F_g = \frac{GMm_p}{r^2}
$$

And radiation pressure is given by a multiplication of the Flux times the scattering cross-section times the momentum transfer per collision divided by the energy of the photon:

$$
F_r = \frac{L}{4\pi r^2} \hspace{0.2cm} \sigma_T \hspace{0.2cm} \frac{h\nu}{c} \hspace{0.2cm} \frac{1}{h\nu} = \frac{\sigma_T L}{4 \pi r^2 c}
$$

Making these two equal and solving for the luminosity gives us our answer:

$$
L_{Edd} = \frac{4 \pi G m_p c}{\sigma_T}
$$
Even though this is a limiting case, objects in nature can actually exceed the Eddington Luminosity. One of the main reasons is that for this derivation, we assumed that the object is mainly made up of ionized Hydrogen atoms (i.e. protons). This means that, for instance, a neutral gas would have a different limiting luminosity. Furthermore, this derivation only considered a very simple model that only included photon scattering ionized H. A more complicated scenario, such as an accreting disk (where clumpy dust is present), would require a more careful treatement for the cross section and account for more ways of momentum transfer.
