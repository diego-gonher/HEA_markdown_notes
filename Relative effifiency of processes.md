Different processes that involve some release of energy can be found in nature. The three main ones are:

## Gravitational
As seen in different types of accretion, gravitational processes can have efficiencies of $\sim 10^{-1}$ eV, making these the most efficient processes, even though gravity is the weakes of the fundamental forces.

## Chemical 
Chemical reactions only achieve efficeincies of about $\sim 10^{-9}$ eV.

## Nuclear 
Nuclear reactions, such as nuclear burning found in the core of MS stars, reach efficiencies of about $\sim 10^{-2}$ eV
