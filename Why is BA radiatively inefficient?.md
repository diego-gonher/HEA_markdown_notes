The way we set up our derivation of the [[Bondi Accretion Rate]] assumed it to be an adiabatic process. For such case to happen, our flow would have to be optically thin and the infall speed too fast (speed of sound of the medium). This in turn means that the Kinetic Energy is not thermilized. 

Unfortunately, this is at odds with observational data, which clearly indicates that there are accreting objects (such as quasars) that are very radiatively efficient. To solve this issue, we would need an accretion rate that is much smaller. 

We can fix this by dropping one of our biggest assumptions: a cloud with no angular momentum. In reality, The matter that is infalling into the BH would have a significant angular momentum, which would slow down the accretion process and would create an optically thick accretion disk. Doing a more careful consideration of this scenario would yield better results.
