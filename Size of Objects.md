Return to [[Overview]]

There are three interesting objects that we saw during the course, and this are their sizes:

## White Dwarf (WD)
WDs have a size comparable to Earth, i.e. $\sim 10^3$ km. They are usually remnants of Giant stars that weren't massive enough to go super nova. They're held by electron degeneracy.

## Neutron Stars
Neutron stars are incredibly compact, with densities comparable to that of an atom's nucleus. This translates in very compact sizes, comparable to small cities, i.e. $\sim 10$ km.

## Black Holes (BH)
BHs are accumulate an incredibly large amount of mass in a small space, causing their escape velocity to be larger than the speed of light $c$. Using this, we can approximate from conservation of energy:

$$
c^2 = \frac{GM_{BH}}{r_{BH}}
$$

Which lands us at:

$$
r_{BH} = \frac{GM_{BH}}{c^2} \approx 1.5 M_{BH} \hspace{0.2cm}\text{km}
$$

Where $M_{BH}$ is in solar masses.
