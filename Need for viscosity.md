- What is the need for viscosity?
- What is the source of free energy? Differential Rotation

## The need for viscosity

As we had mentioned before, viscosity is needed for a few main reasons:

- Allows for transfer on angular momentum outwards, which in turn allows for matter to flow inwards.
- Works as a mechanism to radiate and dissipate energy

If we consider a "microscopic" viscosity (that is, viscosity between the atoms/molecules that make up a disk), then we end up finding that the accretion rates are too low. Possible alternative explanations include:

1) Magnetized rotating winds and jets
2) Large scale non-axisymmetric wave modes
3) Turbulance

Focusing on the last one, we need to find a way of genereting the turbulance. As it turns out, a good source for the free energy required for the instability is differential rotation.

## Differential Rotation

Taking the kinetic energy and the moment of inertia of a fluid element, and using Schwarz inequality, we are able to find that differential rotation indeed is a good source of free energy, where the lowest energy state requires a uniform rotation. As a disk evolves to this lowest state, heat is dissipated from the system. Conceptually, the evolution of the disk goes towards:

$$
\text{uniform T} \Rightarrow T_{high} \rightarrow T_{low} \hspace{0.2cm} \text{via conduction}
$$

$$
\text{uniform } \Omega \Rightarrow \Omega_{high} \rightarrow \Omega_{low} \hspace{0.2cm} \text{via transfer of angular momentum}
$$

As a side note, this eventually can lead to tidal locking (such as the Moon).
